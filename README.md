This is the heart of Leaf MVC. It serves as a bridge between Leaf and the MVC file structure. It provides a ton of functionality that makes it easy to build a full-blown MVC application with Leaf.

## 📦 Installation

You can quickly get leaf mvc core up and running with the leaf cli

```sh
leaf install mvc-core
```

or with composer

```bash
composer require leafs/mvc-core
```

## 🧩 Components

MVC Core comes with:

- Controllers
- Api Controllers
- Database & Models
- Factories
- Models
- Schemas
- Tons of MVC and module globals

Since you don't use this package on its own, the documentation is covered in the [Leaf MVC documentation](https://leafphp.dev/docs/mvc/).
